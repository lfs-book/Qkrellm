The prerequisites for building sysmon-qt are:

- Qt6 (https://linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/x/qt6.html)
- lm-sensors ( https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/general/lm_sensors.html)
  Runtime to monitor temperatures.

To build sysmon-qt run the following commands:

qmake6 sysmon-qt.pro
make

Install the program (as the root user) with:
make install

Three files are installed:
/usr/bin/sysmon-qt
/usr/share/applications/sysmon-qt.desktop
/usr/share/pixmaps/sysmon-qt.png

Notes:
- Use F1 to configure sysmon-qt.
- Use CTRL-F to toggle the frame.  
  - Useful for moving the location.
  - Upon exit, the application will remember it's location.
- Right click brings up a short menu.
